## Setting up development environment

We're using Docker, so things should be relatively straightforward.

1) Download docker and docker-compose by following the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

2) Build the image from the project root:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

3) Run the server

```
$ docker-compose up server
```

4) Navigate to localhost:8080 to see the app running!
